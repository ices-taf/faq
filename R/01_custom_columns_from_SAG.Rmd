### seabass in 4bc... has a summary table and custom table with the recreational catches in there. How do I extract those however from SAG directly from R?

First load the icesSAG library and find the approriate `assessmentKey`.

```{r}
library(icesSAG)

keys <- icesSAG::findAssessmentKey("bss.27.4bc", year = 2021)
```

Then extract the custom columns using the `getCustomColumns` function.
```{r}
custom <- icesSAG::getCustomColumns(keys)
head(custom)
```

Finally, you can restructure the output using something like tidyr and dplyr,
for example:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

custom %>%
  select(Purpose, Year, customName, customValue) %>%
  filter(!is.na(customName)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = "customName", values_from = "customValue")
```
